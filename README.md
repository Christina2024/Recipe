Objective:
*  Create a RESTful API for delicious meatless recipes which are alternatives to meat filled meals. 
* 	Store Data in a JSON File:
   Create a JSON file containing sample recipe data.
* 		Run and Test:
   Run your unit tests to ensure that the functionality is working as expected.
* 		Build the API:
   Implement methods in the RecipeFinder class to serve as the API endpoints, handling HTTP requests.
* 		Deploy and Test API:
   Deploy your API (you can use frameworks like Spring Boot for this) and test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.


🤷🏽‍♀️Why? 
Sustainability -Meat production accounts for 57 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
Healthier alternatives- 1 out of 10 young kids diagnosed everyday. Regularly eating meat associated with 25 different health issues, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer. Substituting meat with alternative protein sources such as beans, legumes and tofu. 
Marketing increase: Amazon, Markets, and Burger King.

🤳🏽Endpoints for customer:
-Search Functionality: Allow users to search for recipes based on criteria like ingredients, cuisine, national events, cultural dishes, special dietary restrictions, etc.
-Recipe Retrieval: Retrieve detailed information about a specific recipe.
-User Authentication: Implement personalised features like saving favorite recipes.


👩🏾‍💻Core technologies used:
I will utilise Java for the backend logic and Spring Boot to create my RESTful API and achieve my API goals. 

>Algorithm-
Binary algorithm to produce faster results.
Implement adding methods to the class to search for recipes based on user input.

>Unit Test-
Create a unit test class using a testing framework like JUnit, as it provides a command-line interface for running tests and a possibility to group tests into suites, making it possible to run multiple tests together.

>JSON file-
Create a JSON file containing sample recipe data.

>Exception Handling-
Implement exception handling for scenarios like file not found or invalid JSON data.
